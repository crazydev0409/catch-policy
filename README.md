## Who We Are

Catch builds tools that help people and businesses coordinate time, meetings, and schedules more reliably. We are responsible for ensuring your personal data is processed lawfully, securely, and transparently.

To deliver Catch smoothly, we work with trusted third-party providers (such as cloud hosting, analytics, and payment services). When we share data with them, we require the same level of care and compliance that we follow ourselves.

## What Data We Collect

We only collect data that's necessary to provide and improve Catch.

### Information You Provide

Name

Email address

Account and profile details

Subscription and billing information

Payments are handled by third-party payment processors (such as the App Store or Google Play). We do not store full payment details.

### Automatically Collected Data

When you use Catch, we may collect:

Device information (device type, operating system)

IP address

Approximate location (based on IP or device settings)

Usage data (how features are used, app interactions)

If the app crashes, we may collect technical diagnostics to improve stability. This data is not used to identify you personally.

## Why We Collect Your Data

We collect data to:

Provide and operate Catch

Predict and coordinate schedules and arrivals

Manage subscriptions and payments

Improve performance, reliability, and features

Communicate important updates

We do not use your data for unrelated purposes without your consent.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

We may share limited data with trusted providers who help us run Catch, such as:

Payment processors

Cloud hosting and infrastructure providers

Analytics and performance monitoring services

Some data may be processed outside the EU/EEA. When this happens, we use approved safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure GDPR-level protection.

We only share the minimum data necessary for each purpose.

### Location and Scheduling Data

Catch may process availability, scheduling, and optional location signals to help coordinate plans and predict timing.
We focus on patterns and outcomes, not content. Private event details are not shared with other users or businesses without your permission.

You control what you share and can adjust permissions at any time.

## Children's Privacy

Catch is not intended for children under 13.

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental or guardian consent. If we discover such data has been collected without consent, we will delete it promptly.

## How We Keep Your Data Safe

We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure infrastructure, to protect your data.

No system is completely secure, but we continuously work to protect your data and reduce risk. You're responsible for keeping your account credentials confidential.
